                    Second Spray: Oftentimes, if flowering is poor or does not occur, a second spray using low concentration of KNO3 should be applied 10-14 days after the first spray. This procedure can increase flowering in mango.

               <p>addition to the low sodium basket, we now have Haifa Cal™ Prime, a calcium nitrate that is low in sodium as well as ammonia, a key requirement of modern, hi-tech greenhouse systems. The Australian Haifa team is always looking to our international colleagues and what they are working on. We are always seeking new and innovative ways to provide the nutrients our crops need – we call this “Pioneering the Future’’. Not only do we look outwardly, but we also show the way. Haifa recently launched the new Junior range of controlled release fertiliser (CRF). The key concept of Junior is to provide a unique CRF blend when planting trees. We have been doing this for the past seven years in Australia. Our unique forestry blend has become the industry standard for planting eucalyptus seedlings. Ultimately, this illustrates that when you buy Haifa, you are buying global experience. Fertiliser products that are tested in more than 100 countries with every crop imaginable. We are not just a fertiliser company – we are a global nutrition company helping to feed the world<br> Not only do we look outwardly, but we also show the way.

               <p>A proper post-harvest fertilization of apple orchards is highly important. High density orchards are likely to come under stress after the harvest, and replenishing the tree’s reserves for next season is a needed. Next season growth potential is determined by the nutritional reserves that have been built up in the buds at leaf fall.

                The right application time is between fruit removal and leaf fall when leaves and roots are still active, and able to absorb the nutrients.
                
                The most important nutrients that are needed to top-up at this period are nitrogen (N) and potassium (K). Up to 30% of the total annual application of N & K nutrient should be applied at this period.
                Nitrogen and potassium are used during bloom from stored reserves from the previous year’s application. Foliar application is the most effective way to directly raise nutrient concentrations in the floral bud. As nutrients are needed in large quantities,  a couple of foliar sprays are normally necessary.
